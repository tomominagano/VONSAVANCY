                      <p>There is always a long line during lunch break. Did you wait about 40 minutes today? I had you go to the open terrace seat. The terrace seats are comfortable this season. The nice breeze is blowing and it's very relaxing. I had a lunch course. This course includes appetizer, pasta, main course, dessert, and coffee. You can choose pasta and main. For pasta, I chose mushroom fusilli. Fusilli is a pasta whose noodles are thick, short and spiral. It's easy to get entangled with the soup and it's easy to eat. Mainly, I chose herb grilled chicken. The grilled chicken in this shop is my favorite. It is a firm and tender chicken that is fragrantly baked. It's really delicious. It was a very delicious lunch. Also, the open terrace seats were the best. In the big city, surrounded by trees, small birds are singing. I was very healed.</p>

                    <div class="story">
                      <p>At noon on a holiday, I can do business and decide to come here for lunch.
                        I once came by car a few years ago the night before, but I forgot why, but I couldn't get in.
                        When you go up to the 6th floor, the shop is spacious and relaxing. There is a lot of green outside.
                        The appetizer was prosciutto, salty and delicious.
                        The main thing was I was short pasta and was it orecchiette? It's quite spicy with hawk claws.
                        The vine was seasonal pasta. It was a lot of cherry tomatoes.
                        The dessert was granita, which was usually delicious. And a drink is included.
                        I think that 1800 yen is very cheap with this content.
                        Of course, it's supposed to be delicious (laughs)
                        Also, the timing of the serve is very good, and I think that the shop staff is keeping an eye on it.</p>

                      <p>I wasn't lined up this time, but I'll just wait in the outside chair for a while while I'm asked to make a seat.
                      This is also a solid social distance, and you can sit with one empty.
                      
                      The inside was quite large, and about 90% of the customers were there, but I was guided to the back and went to a table in an area like a separate room.
                      Unlike the open area, there are few tables and you can see the outside BBQ corner and greenery, so you can relax.
                      It's been a while since I was in Shinjuku, and I was a little surprised by the number of people, so I'm lucky at this seat ☆
                      
                      It seems that there are 3 types of lunch only in the course.
                      I had a reasonable lunch for pasta because I had a plan for the next one.
                      However, it is a set that comes with an appetizer and dessert.
                      
                      First appetizer
                      Prosciutto
                      Fruit tomato caprese
                      Sauerkraut with cheese and almonds
                      
                      The prosciutto is also a large cut, and the sauerkraut becomes a little voluminous and responsive when mixed with almonds.
                      Death that such an arrangement is also fun.
                      
                      For pasta
                      Seasonal pasta
                      This day is corn and summer vegetables. It seems that it is an accent with mint.
                      Is it a little too boiled when you first set it aside? I thought, but instead, it has a chewy texture like fresh pasta.
                      The taste is light, but the corn seems to be boiled raw rather than canned, and the original texture of the corn is alive and delicious.
                      The sourness of tomatoes is moderate, and the aroma of mint is fluffy.
                      Personally, maybe a little more salt or pepper is working
                      
                      The other item is "Orecchiette with salsiccia and rape blossoms," which seems to be the most popular in the shop.
                      The really cute earlobe pasta is an adult taste that the chili peppers firmly insist on, as if betraying the imagination.
                      Italian sausage is also a good taste.
                      If there is green on the plate, not only the color but also the appetite will be enhanced.
                      
                      The dessert is granita
                      I didn't explain this, but I think it was a tomato.
                      The refreshing acidity goes well with the vanilla ice cream above.
                      I chose herbal tea as the drink, but I was very satisfied with the food, which was kind to the body until the end.
                      
                      Not only the food, but also this seat, which is a little far away, seems to be watching the situation diligently despite the congestion, and served to the end at the perfect timing.
                      
                      It seems that they are actively using vegetables in the suburbs, and that kind of concept is also good.
                      
                      It was very delicious and I enjoyed a relaxing lunch.
                      
                      Thank you for your feast</p>

                    <div class="story">
                      <p>I had to wait for two groups before visiting without a reservation, so I lined up because there was a bench.

                        I was surprised that 30 minutes had passed when I noticed
                        I was finally guided to my seat.
                        
                        The open and bright interior of the store is fitted with glass and the door to the terrace is open for ventilation.
                        
                        Choose from 3 types of courses to order.
                        I'm the most reasonable
                        I chose a 1980 yen course.
                        
                        ○ Appetizer
                        Prosciutto salad
                        
                        ○ Selectable pasta
                        Homemade rigatoni with asparagus shimeji mushrooms
                        With truffle mascarpone
                        
                        The scent of truffle mascarpone is good and the saltiness is slightly stronger.
                        Just right for me, who has a strong taste
                        It was delicious and I ate it in no time.
                        
                        ○ Dolce
                        Gateau chocolat
                        The sweetness was modest and delicious.
                        
                        ○ Coffee, tea, herbal tea (hot or ice)
                        
                        I made ice herbal tea.
                        The pink color is beautiful and it is easy to drink without any habit.
                        
                        Bright and open interior and atmosphere.
                        Satisfaction with course meals.
                        The price is less than 2,000 yen.
                        
                        This is excellent cost performance.
                        
                        It was a feast.
                        
                        You can put a stroller and a wheelchair, but you should ask on the first floor because there is a direct elevator when you enter the store.
                        If you head from the east exit, you will move to the 4th floor and take the elevator to the 6th floor, so it seems to be a detour.</p>
